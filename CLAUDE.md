# Project Instructions
- No AI attribution in commits
- Writing: keep user's voice, first person, conversational, no em dashes, stick closely to what user said without making things up, but fix small grammar mistakes
- Testing: use tmux to control Claude Code instances (send-keys, capture-pane)
- After adding or renaming tips, run `node scripts/generate-toc.js` to update the table of contents
